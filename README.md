This project provides a collection of Java examples demonstrating the use of interfaces. Interfaces in Java allow you to define a contract for classes to implement, promoting loose coupling and polymorphism. The examples cover various scenarios where interfaces are used to define common behaviors that can be implemented by different classes.
