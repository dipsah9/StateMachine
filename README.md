# StateMachine
This project provides a collection of Java examples demonstrating the use of interfaces. Interfaces in Java allow you to define a contract for classes to implement, promoting loose coupling and polymorphism. The examples cover various scenarios where interfaces are used to define common behaviors that can be implemented by different classes.

To compile the code. Clone the repo and give the commmand : javac pathToFile/StateMachine.java
And to run: java pathToFile/StateMachine

Starting point of the Machine is "PiratesIsland" and the goal is "TreasureIsland". Use can follow the instructions given on the terminal to get to the goal.
It is demonstration of how interfaces actually works and is meaningful in our real life.
